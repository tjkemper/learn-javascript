# functions.md
* functions are first-class objects
  * they can be passed, returned, and stored just like any other value
* Function inherits from Object and can store name/value pairs
* What JavaScript calls function, other language call lambda
  * JavaScript was the first lambda based language to go mainstream
* function statement is shorthand for var statement
  * `function foo(){}` *expands to* `var foo = function(){}`



### scope
* there is a global scope
* functions have scope
* nothing else has scope
  * there is no block scope in JavaScript
  * this means, define your variables at the beginning of the function

### closure



### method
* a method is a function that belongs to an object

### invocation
* if a function is called with too many arguments, the extra arguments are ignored
* if a function is called with too few arguments, the missing values with be undefined
* no type checking on parameters
* every function gets an `arguments` parameter
* every function gets a `this` parameter, but what it points to depends on the **invocation form**
  * that means that `this` is bound at invocation time

### invocation forms
* function form `someFn(args)`
* method form `someObj.someFn(args)` or `someObj["someFn"](args)`
* constructor form `new someFn(args)`
* apply form `someFn.apply(someObj, [args])`

### function form
* `this` points to the global object
* that is not very useful
* cause of many bugs

### method form
* `this` points to the object which was used during method invocation
```
someObj.someFn(); //inside of someFn, 'this' will point to someObj
```

### constructor form
* when a function is called with the `new` operator, a new object is created and assigned to `this`
* if there is no explicit return statement, then `this` will be returned

### apply form
* looks weird
* allows you to invoke a method while dynamically setting the object
* `this` points to the object that you pass into the `apply` method
